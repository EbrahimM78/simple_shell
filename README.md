# Simple Shell
****

## What is the shell?

Creating a simple shell that can accept input and run commands.
It is a command line interpreter, which takes the most basic commands and executes them.

## How Do I compile it?

This shell works by compiling with versions of GCC 4.8.5 or later, it can be compiled
using

`gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o shell`


## Essential Functionalities of the Simple Shell:

> Displays a prompt "#cisfun$ " and waits for user input.\
> Runs all commands of type "executable program" (ls and /bin/ls).\
> Handles commands with arguments.\
> Handles the PATH global variable.\
> Handles The EOF (End Of File) condition.\
> Handles the Ctrl + C signal -> It doesn't exit the shell

## Usage
